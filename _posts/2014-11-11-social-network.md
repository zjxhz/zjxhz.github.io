Human beings are social creatures with emotional needs. Therefore, people who think themselves deserve more attention are eager to keep their audiences informed with small matters, such as ‘I am hungry!’, or ‘I have just ran another marathon!’, etc., which is neither interesting nor impressive. 

It is not only the small matters that are bothering. Promoting products or services, which are usually not competitive or attractive by the way, is probably another source of annoying information. 
Chicken soup, yeah! It might be inspiring to you, but it means little to me. So thanks but no.

Well, life is tough, and we know that. We are here looking for the fun, not the other shit. Why would anyone stay awake till late night and just cannot stop complaining?

I am not bothered at all, you are safe in the block list.
