[Matt Kuleza](http://1000pluscoffees.tumblr.com/) is a student from Melbourne who wants to meet all of his 1000+ friends on Facebook by having a cup of coffee together. I find this idea interesting and would like do something similar starting in 2015, especially with those I rarely meet. I will be in Hangzhou on 1st and 4th, and in Zhuji on 2nd and 3rd. Interested? Join me for a cup of coffee, jogging or mountaineering. 

有个老外决定要和朋友圈里所有的朋友都见个面，熟的和不熟的，方式是请他们喝一杯咖啡。2015年，我也想做一件类似的事情，特别是那些难得一见的朋友。感兴趣的一起喝杯咖啡，跑步或爬山。1号和4号在杭州，2号和3号在诸暨。
