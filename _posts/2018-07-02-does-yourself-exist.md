The Buddha’s definition of the self, seems to be something that endures and persists over time; also, the self has full control over the aggregates that constitute a person, namely the forms(body), perceptions, feelings, emotions, and consciousness. He claims that such self does not exist because these aggregates are impermanent, and they are not fully controlled by the self. 

According to this definition, I agree that the self does not exist. 

Modern scientific and psychological researches have also, to some extent, supported this idea. For example, science has shown that the human body consists of molecules or elements that can be found from other organisms, too. The consciousness of a self, after all, is a series of physical and chemical activities of elements. On a higher level, cells are being replaced all the time. Studies have shown that most of the cells of the human body are renewed in about 7 years. This means that the physical form of the self, you, are not the same self as the one a few years before. Therefore, it is not clear which self, even if there is one, is being addressed when referenced. 

Some experiment, like the one mentioned in the lecture, has also suggested that there seem to be more than one “selves” in the human brain. In the experiment, a patient, whose connection between the left brain and right brain is removed, starts to behave inconsistently when two parts of the brain are given different instructions. For example, one part of the brain may command the person to walk(by following the instruction it sees), while the other part has no idea why this happened(as the two parts cannot communicate) and comes up with a completely different story which itself is fully convinced. In this case, I would argue that the self is ambiguous and thus no unique self can be found in a person.

To summarize, I argue that a “permanent" and unique self does not exist and the continuity of the self is a delusion. The main reasons are that the physical form of the self changes over time, and there is not an unambiguous self in a human body.
