Recently I was asked about what attracts Chinese traveling abroad. I asked the same question to a few of my friends and here are some of the answers.

 - Sceneries. The natural views are generally better preserved in foreign countries. Islands, beaches are popular destinations. For me, I like forests and peaceful countrysides, preferably covered by snow - so Finland was a perfect place. I guess many people would have the same opinion. However, northern Europe is less popular in China because it is far away and it is much more costly.
  - Cultural diversity. People are more or less curious about the cultures and viewpoints that differ from their own. China is a big country, and thanks to its mostly worthless passport, it is very inconvenient for its citizen to travel abroad. China is also regarded as a country that is less open in terms of information transparency. So Chinese can become quite surprised by the way people in other counties think and behave. We tend to work hard and save money for the future but may lack the ability of living in the moment. Also, I feel that people from other countries are more kind and well-mannered.
  - Shopping. For luxuries or whatever that cost more to buy in China.
  - Budget airlines. Airasia is one of them, sometimes the tickets can be unbelievably cheap. On the other hand, domestic travels are not as affordable as they used to be. For example, the prices of tickets and accommodations of some tourist attractions are insanely high, especially during popular holidays.
