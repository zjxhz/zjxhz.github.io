### The Video
<embed src="http://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XNjAyNzkyODQw/v.swf" allowFullScreen="true" quality="high" width="480" height="400" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">

### Note
I have to say that my English was that good, but I hope you can understand. And I didn't practice it a lot, the video was recorded only once, so you may find that sometimes I didn't know what to say and what to do next.   

Anyway, it is the first demo video I recorded about TDD, maybe in the future I will try again and provide a better version.
